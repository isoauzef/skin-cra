# OEM Landing Page (Create React App)

This repository wraps the existing OEM Korean Skin Care landing page in a standard [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) toolchain. The static markup now lives in `public/index.html`, all vendor assets are served locally from `public/assets`, and a tiny React harness exposes the legacy `route()` / `linkMethod()` navigation helpers.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```powershell
cd skin-cra
npm install
```

### Configure Stripe test credentials

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Stripe **test** publishable and secret keys.
3. Adjust `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`, `STRIPE_SERVER_PORT`, and `CORS_ORIGIN` if you change the dev ports.

### Start the local Stripe backend

```powershell
npm run server
```

This spins up a minimal Express server at [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242) that issues PaymentIntents for the checkout form.

### Run the CRA dev server (in a second terminal)

```powershell
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the landing page with the embedded Stripe Elements checkout.

> **Test card reminder:** use `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, and any CVC/ZIP to simulate a successful payment.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
